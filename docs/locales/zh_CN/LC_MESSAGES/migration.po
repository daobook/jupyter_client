"All of the API changes for `KernelManager` and `AsyncKernelManager` in "
"the 7.0 release were confined to _internal public_ methods, which we "
"define as methods called from the _formally public_ methods but could be "
"overridden in subclass implementations. As a result, these changes may "
"impact subclasses of `KernelManager` or `AsyncKernelManager` provided "
"those implementations also implement or call these methods, but should "
"not affect applications that call only the _formally public_ methods."
